# Xend Payment SDK

This is the test Xend Payment Sdk. Like the live one, it allows a user to make payments via the payment methods made available to them by xend. For now, the sdk supports making payments
via 
* Xend (If the sender is already a xend user)
* Bank account (If the sender or the sendee have reserved an account for this purpose)
* Paystack 
* Monnify

### How to Use
You can use jsdeliver to allow github to serve they sdk in your project 

### Inline sample
```html
<form >
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xend-services/sdkassets/payxend.min.js"></script>
    <button type="button" onclick="openXendSdk()"> Pay </button> 
</form>
